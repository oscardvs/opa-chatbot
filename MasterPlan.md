I'll break this down into clear phases:

Phase 1: Project Restructuring
1. Create a new directory structure to accommodate both web and desktop versions
```
opa/
├── packages/
│   ├── web/          (current web implementation)
│   │   └── [all current files]
│   └── desktop/      (new electron implementation)
│       ├── electron/
│       └── src/
└── package.json      (workspace root)
```

2. Set up workspace management:
- Convert to monorepo structure using npm workspaces or pnpm
- Move current implementation into web package
- Create new desktop package

Phase 2: Desktop App Setup
1. Initialize Electron project:
```bash
cd packages/desktop
npm init
npm install electron electron-builder electron-is-dev
```

2. Core desktop files needed:
- electron/main.js (main process)
- electron/preload.js (preload scripts)
- src/ (copy of current React app)
- electron-builder.json (build configuration)

3. Port current web implementation:
- Copy over React components
- Modify build configuration
- Update import paths
- Adapt API calls for desktop environment

Phase 3: Claude Integration
1. Modify server implementation:
- Move API handling to desktop app
- Update Claude API calls to include computer use
- Create secure local storage for API keys

2. Add ROS-specific features:
- ROS environment detection
- Package workspace management
- Build system integration

Phase 4: Testing Infrastructure
1. Set up test environment:
- Local ROS workspace for testing
- Package generation tests
- Integration tests for Claude's computer use

Phase 5: Build & Distribution
1. Configure electron-builder
2. Set up automated builds
3. Create update mechanism
4. Configure code signing

Detailed First Steps:

1. First, let's create the new project structure:
```bash
# Create new directory structure
mkdir -p opa/packages/{web,desktop}

# Move current files to web package
mv * opa/packages/web/
cd opa

# Initialize workspace
npm init -w packages/web -w packages/desktop
```

2. Create the desktop package foundation:
```bash
cd packages/desktop
npm init
npm install electron electron-builder electron-is-dev
npm install react react-dom axios @anthropic-ai/sdk
```

3. Initial desktop app files:
```bash
mkdir -p electron src public
touch electron/main.js electron/preload.js
```

Would you like me to proceed with the implementation details for any of these phases? I can start with either:

1. Setting up the monorepo structure
2. Creating the basic Electron app
3. Migrating the current OPA implementation
4. Implementing the Claude integration with computer use

Let me know which part you'd like to tackle first, and I'll provide detailed implementation steps.
